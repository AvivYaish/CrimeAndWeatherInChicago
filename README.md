## Authors: Aviv Yaish, David Barda, Yuval Shavit

A project exploring the relationship between crime and weather in Chicago.


### Installation and Usage
1. Install libraries:

    a. Install Anaconda 4.3.0:

        https://www.continuum.io/downloads

    b. Install folium 0.3:

        https://github.com/python-visualization/folium

    c. Install branca:

        pip install branca

    d. Install pyowm:

        pip install pyowm

2. Make sure you have the datasets:

    a. Crime dataset:

        Export as CSV from:

            https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

        Put in:

            ./data/crime_data_original.csv

    b. Weather dataset:

        Requires authorization from NOAA.

        Put in:

            ./data/weather_data.csv

3. Prepare the data:

        python prepare_data.py

4. Visualizations:

    a. Make sure this folder exists:

        ./static/maps

    b. Create the map visualizations:

        python viz.py

    c. Now you can access the heatmap in:

        ./static/heatmap.html

5. Crime prediction:

    a. Create the crime predictor:

        python machine_learning.py

    b. Run the server:

        python server.py

    c. Now you can access the crime predictor in:

        http://localhost:3000/predict.html

6. The index (including the PDF) is in:

        http://localhost:3000/index.html
